12/23/2021 03:08:06 PM [INFO]: Loading tokenizer and model...
12/23/2021 03:08:06 PM [INFO]: Added key: store_based_barrier_key:1 to store for rank: 0
Some weights of the model checkpoint at ./model/bert-base-uncased were not used when initializing BertmodelRE: ['cls.predictions.decoder.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.predictions.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertmodelRE from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertmodelRE from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of BertmodelRE were not initialized from the model checkpoint at ./model/bert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['bert.classification_layer.weight', 'bert.classification_layer.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
